# Shopping List App
A simple mobile app for a university assessment. It is designed to be a on-the-go digital shopping list so that the user can easily add and check off items in a list while shopping. 

The app was implemented in Android Studio using Java and XML code. I designed the UI with minimal features so that the user can focus on the most important information on the screen (the shopping list).
